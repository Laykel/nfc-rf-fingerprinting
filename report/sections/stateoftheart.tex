\section{State of the art}

\subsection{Taxonomy}

It is certainly useful to start with a review of the different ways to categorize the features and algorithms used by researchers in the field of Radio Frequency Machine Learning (RFML). The goal is to define our needs precisely and select the important things to consider.

\subsubsection{Taxonomy for features} \label{features_tax}

The features we select must allow us to identify a precise device among potentially very similar devices. We need what \textcite{delgado_passive_2020} describe as a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). PUFs are physical distortions that are unique to a specific system. They are another way of talking about fingerprints.

\textcite{xu_device_2015} propose three ways to categorize radio signal features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item based on the specificity of the feature (from vendor specific to device specific),
  \item based on the layers (PHY, MAC, Network and higher),
  \item and based on the acquisition method (passive or active).
\end{itemize}

Features from the MAC and higher layers typically require in depth knowledge of the protocols in play. Not only that, but they also tend to be less specific than we would like (either vendor specific or depending on the type of device). This indicates we should probably focus on the physical (PHY) layer features, which rely on imperfections in the manufacturing process of the devices.

\subsubsection{Taxonomy for fingerprinting algorithms}

\textcite{riyaz_deep_2018} provide a visual categorization of fingerprinting approaches, which we adapt in figure \ref{fig:algo-taxo}. We take a look at these approaches in the following paragraphs.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Supervised approaches:} Supervised approaches use features from labelled data to generate a function capable of separating the different classes. These approaches can be further categorized in similarity based and classification techniques.

Similarity based techniques are white-list algorithm that use a database of fingerprints and a similarity measure to determine whether a device is legitimate. Developing a technique like this usually requires prior knowledge of vendor specific device features \cite{riyaz_deep_2018}.

Classification systems can also require deep knowledge of the features and protocols used, in the case of "traditional", manually tuned classifiers. Those are built to extract predetermined features and work similarly to other white-list algorithms afterwards.

In this age of deep learning though, research seems to be more interested in classification techniques that are able to extract the features they need by themselves. This can be done through deep Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) \cite{delgado_passive_2020, stankowicz_complex_2019} or through more advanced techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) \cite{riyaz_deep_2018, oyedare_estimating_2019, youssef_machine_2017, morin_transmitter_2019, sankhe_no_2019}. The latter have proved very powerful in domains like computer vision, natural language processing and recommendation systems. This success is one of the reasons experimentations on CNNs are common in RFML research.

\paragraph{Unsupervised systems:} Unsupervised approaches cannot by themselves discriminate a legitimate device from an illegitimate one. They don't have that information, since they work with unlabeled data. In order to detect attempts of impersonation, such a system has to keep a record of fingerprints and linked identifiers (MAC addresses, serial numbers...). It can then throw an alert and update a black-list when multiple fingerprints are linked to the same ID or when multiple IDs are linked to the same fingerprint \cite{xu_device_2015, nguyen_device_2011}.

\textcite{xu_device_2015} specify that unsupervised approaches are appropriate when the fingerprints of legitimate devices are not available.

\subsection{Acquisition}

The vast majority of the research considered for this project uses USRP systems to record transmissions as raw I/Q signals. The number of devices can be anywhere from 5 to 500 (but most often less than 20). They all use data acquired from WiFi (802.11) or Zigbee (802.15.4) devices. \cite{riyaz_deep_2018, oyedare_estimating_2019, youssef_machine_2017, morin_transmitter_2019, sankhe_no_2019, nguyen_device_2011}

WiFi and Zigbee both use Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation schemes. They differ from NFC's modulation scheme: On-Off Keying (OOK) which is a form of Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK). (Except for NFC type B, which uses BPSK in target to initiator mode.)

Some, like \textcite{sankhe_no_2019}, also describe how they add artificially induced impairments to simulated signals with MatLab.

\subsection{Features}

\subsubsection{Features selection}

Even if we don't plan to manually select and extract the features that will form the fingerprints of our devices, it is useful to learn about them. It will allow us to make sure they are present for the algorithm to extract and also allow us to design preprocessing methods that magnify the features.

Whether we end up with a system that is able to identify many devices uniquely, or one that only tries to separate a specific device from the others, we will need device specific accuracy. We don't want to make relay attacks impossible only if the attacker doesn't use a device from the same vendor as the victim's device. This is why in section \ref{features_tax}, we concluded that the features we are most interested in are from the physical layer.

Because of their nature, these features should be appropriate no matter the protocol used. The following list is composed of features described by \textcite{riyaz_deep_2018} and also used in other works.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{I/Q imbalance:} The amplitude and the phase are not exactly the same on the in-phase and the quadrature signals, because of the imperfections in the quadrature mixers.
  \item{Phase noise:} When the baseband signal is up-converted to the carrier frequency, it is sensible to phase noise which creates rotational vibrations.
  \item{Carrier frequency offset:} The difference between the carrier frequency of the transmitter and the carrier frequency of the receiver.
  \item{Harmonic distortions:} The Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC) cause harmonic distortions because of imperfections.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}

It is clear that preprocessing the data appropriately can greatly increase the accuracy of a model and reduce its complexity.

The first question to ask is how should the data be partitioned, in order to be fed to the learning algorithm. This question will be discussed in section \ref{nn-architecture} since it is identical to choosing the input of our model.

Several works mention wavelet transforms (either discrete or continuous) as effective means to amplify the characteristic features of a wireless device \cite{xu_device_2015, oyedare_estimating_2019, youssef_machine_2017}. They report increased accuracy and scalability, and reduced complexity. It is certainly worth it to explore this preprocessing method.

\subsection{Machine learning applied to radio frequency}

Difficulties (ref)

\subsubsection{Supervised or unsupervised}

This describes the work done by \textcite{nguyen_device_2011} on such a system. They use a Nonparametric Bayesian model to cluster devices based on their fingerprints. This technique allows them to discriminate between an unknown number of devices that the model never encountered before.

They show good results with four devices using two features strictly from the PHY layer.

In the context of this project, this would require us to be able to record the NFC serial number of a device at the same time as we extract the fingerprint.

\subsubsection{Comparing supervised approaches}

Several articles have compared the performance of different machine learning approaches.

SVM, DNN, CNN, MST A-LM

CNNs -> good shift invariance thanks to pooling layer?
