\section{Conclusion}

Through this document, we defined the problem at hand and discussed existing works to highlight challenges and guide our project. We also reported on our experiments with SDR hardware, and the decisions made to set up the acquisition layout. We then listed the devices we had gathered as of this writing and their characteristics. Lastly, we showed our analysis of the data and the steps already taken to create the dataset of NFC transmissions.

We are convinced that the conception of a robust dataset is a primordial step towards the solution, and we are now in full possession of the needed knowledge and hardware to build it and ensure its quality.

As the project continues, this dataset will be used as training and testing data in the development of our supervised learning model. We will describe the realized experiments and analyse the performance of our solutions in the final report of this project.
