{\bfseries Publishable summary}

{
  NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi and every common wireless communication protocol operate using radio waves. To do so, the data to be transmitted must be converted to some type of modulation of a carrier wave. This requires complex analog components that, because of their nature, cannot be completely identical to one another. The inherent imperfections of these analog components is what makes Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting possible. Indeed, this technique theoretically allows the identification of a device just through the analysis of its signal.

  \textbf{Instead of the following paragraph, describe what actually happened}
  This project's goal is to determine whether applying machine learning techniques to the problem of RF fingerprinting is effective. More specifically, we will try to identify NFC tags and see if such a solution could work as an authentication technique in order to prevent, for example, relay attacks.
