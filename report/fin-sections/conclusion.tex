\section{Conclusion}

During this project, we have achieved tasks as varied as the elaboration of an acquisition setup for radio waves, attempts at decoding a modulated signal, signal processing, data manipulation, and building deep learning models.

Despite our best efforts to try as many things as possible, we have only scratched the surface of the theme of radio frequency machine learning. There are many elements we would have loved to explore: data preprocessing methods like wavelet transforms, dataset augmentation through sliding windows, complex weighted neural networks, unsupervised techniques, etc. These topics will have to be left to future work, as this project comes to an end.

Our results, while not overwhelming, are reasonably good and gave us reasons to believe the task to be feasible. We are able to give elements of answers and open paths for future development.
