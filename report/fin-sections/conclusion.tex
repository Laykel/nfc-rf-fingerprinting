\section{Conclusion}

During this project, we have achieved tasks as varied as the elaboration of an acquisition setup for radio waves, attempts at decoding a modulated signal, learning about signal processing and data manipulation, and building deep neural networks.

Despite our best efforts to try as many things as possible, we have only scratched the surface of the theme of radio frequency machine learning. There are many elements we would have loved to explore: data preprocessing methods like wavelet transforms, dataset augmentation through sliding windows, complex weighted neural networks, unsupervised techniques, etc. These topics will have to be left to future work, as this project comes to an end.

We have learned a tremendous amount of useful knowledge in several complex domains and are satisfied with our thesis even though, as we said before, we would have enjoyed going further in analysing the results and improving the different aspects of the project.

Our results, while not overwhelming, are positive and give us reasons to believe the task is feasible. We are able to give elements of answers and to open paths for future developments, which will hopefully give way to more scalable solutions.

This report, the source code, and the datasets are all available on the git repository mentioned in this document's introduction (\ref{intro}).
