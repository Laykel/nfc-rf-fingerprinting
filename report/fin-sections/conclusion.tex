\section{Conclusion}

Reminisce

  Learned about SDR, signal processing (CWT, peaks, norm...), CNNs, fingerprinting...

What I would have done differently? (don't spend as much time chasing the decoding holy grail. start ML earlier. find better hardware)

Conclude

Going further (fingerprinting, datasets, other preprocessing, feature engineering, complex nn)
